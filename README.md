# Geneds Go To Hell
Gened classes are annoying: their weekly reading PDF's are purely images and not ah'hem, searchable! This tool converts these pdf's into txt files. 

## Environments
Two libraries are needed: `pymupdf` and `easyocr`. Both needs to be installed using `pip3`. If using Conda environment, try the following command:
```
path-to-conda-env/bin/pip3 install packagename
```

## Usage
1. Create a folder containing all pdf's you wish to convert
2. Move `extractor.py` into the folder
3. Execute `python3 extractor.py` from the folder
